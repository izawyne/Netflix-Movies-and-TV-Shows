# **Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis**

This project analyzes a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows to extract meaningful insights about trends in the platform's catalog. 
The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in genre, release year, and content type, as well as exploring country-specific contributions and other key attributes.

## **Project Overview**

The main goal of this analysis is to:
* Explore the dataset for insights about Netflix's catalog.
* Visualize trends in content distribution across different years.
* Highlight outliers and trends using custom visualizations.
The dataset used for this project contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including their release date, duration, genre, country of origin, and more.

## **Technologies and Tools Used**

* Python: for data manipulation and analysis.
* Pandas 2.0.3: for cleaning, processing, and exploring the dataset.
* Jupyter Notebook: for interactive code execution and documentation.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: for data visualization and graphical insights.
* NumPy: for numerical operations.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

## **Key Insights**
Here are some of the highlights from the analysis:

* Content Growth: The number of movies and TV shows on Netflix has seen significant growth, particularly in recent years.
* Genre Popularity: Certain genres, such as drama and comedy, consistently dominate the catalog.
* Country Trends: The United States remains the largest contributor to Netflix’s library, but there’s increasing international representation.

## **Visualizations**
Custom visualizations were created to better illustrate the findings, with personalized color schemes to emphasize trends and outliers. Some key graphs include:
* Content Over Time: A line chart showing the growth of Netflix's content library.
* Genre Distribution: A bar chart comparing the popularity of different genres.
* Top Countries: A breakdown of the top contributing countries to the Netflix library.

## **Future Improvements**
* Perform further analysis to explore more in-depth correlations between content type and ratings.
* Add machine learning models to predict future content trends on Netflix.
* Enhance data visualizations for better storytelling.
